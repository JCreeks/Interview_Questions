#### Regularization
What is the difference between Ridge and Lasso regression?

#### SVM
Can you use Support Vector Machine to do multi-class classification?

LibSVM uses the *one-against-one* approach for multi-class learning problems. From the [FAQ][1]:

> Q: What method does libsvm use for multi-class SVM ? Why don't you use the "1-against-the rest" method ?

>It is one-against-one. We chose it after doing the following comparison: C.-W. Hsu and C.-J. Lin. [A comparison of methods for multi-class support vector machines][2], IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks, 13(2002), 415-425.
